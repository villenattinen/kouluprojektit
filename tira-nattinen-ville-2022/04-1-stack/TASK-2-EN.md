# Stack exercise part 2

Tietorakenteet ja algoritmit | Data structures and algorithms 2021.

## The goal

The goal of this exercise is to test the stack data structure you created to perform an actual useful task. You will use the stack to check if parentheses in structured text (files) are correct or not.

For example, this is a valid text considering the usage of parentheses, retrieved from [Linnanmaa weather station](http://weather.willab.fi/weather.json):

```JSON
{
  "tempnow": 1.7,
  "temphi": 7.4,
  "templo": -1.6,
  "dewpoint": 1.4,
  "humidity": 98,
  "airpressure": 1005.1,
  "windspeed": 3.3,
  "windspeedmax": 7.6,
  "winddir": 174,
  "precipitation1d": 0,
  "precipitation1h": 0,
  "timestamp": "2021-10-14 11:11 EEST"
}
```
But this Java sample code has a problem; there is an extra closing `}` before last line:

```Java
  if (currentIndex >= capacity - 1) {
    reallocateInternalArray();
    }
  }
  itemArray[++currentIndex] = element;         
```
The implementation here should report the first JSON as valid, and the second Java example as invalid because the parentheses do not match.

## Prerequisites

You have completed the first task of this exercise and your `StackImplementation` passes the `StackTests`.

## Instructions

In this exercise you will use a `StackImplementation` which handles Character data type instead of an Integer. 

Following the implementation of the `StackFactory.createIntegerStack()` **implement** another method which creates a Character stack.

**Open** the test `ParenthesisTests.java`. You will see that it contains unit tests to check if two files have correct parentheses or not. The tests use a `ParenthesisChecker.checkParentheses()` method to do the actual checking.

**Your task** is to **implement the `ParenthesisChecker.checkParentheses()` method** so that it uses the `StackImplementation` you just finished to check if the files to be tested have correct parenthesis or not.

There are two files that are tested in the project `src/test/resources` directory. The `SSN.java` is correct, but the `Person.json` file is not. That is why the test for the second file expects it to throw an exception:

```Java
   assertThrows(ParenthesesException.class, () -> checkParentheses(toCheck), "Person.json is invalid JSON so must throw");
```
Note that the test still passes successfully, since the failure to check the Person.json file is *expected*. If the test would actually fail, it would mean that checkParentheses() would _not_ throw -- that would be a real problem and failure in *your* implementation if that would happen.

**Follow the instructions** in the comments of `ParenthesisChecker.checkParentheses()` and implement the method. 

Method must check if the string has correct parenthesis, using the stack you implemented. The method must throw an exception, if the parentheses are not correct.

## Testing 

**Run the ParenthesisTests tests** to make sure your stack implementation passes the unit tests. From command line, you can execute the tests (in the directory that contains the exercise `pom.xml` file):

```
mvn -Dtest=ParenthesisTests test
```

If the tests do not pass, you will see errors. Otherwise you will see that the tests succeed. 

Note that at this point you can also execute all the tests:

```
mvn test
```

Especially if you have *changed* your `StackImplementation` to fix any issues with it, it is necessary to execute *regression testing* (running the already executed tests again).

When working with this exercise, **do not**:

* change the `StackInterface` class in any way,
* change the unit tests in any way,
* change the `SSN.java` nor `Person.json` files in any way.

## Delivery

After all your tests pass, you should deliver your submission to the exercise as instructed in the course.
